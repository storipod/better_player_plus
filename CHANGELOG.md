## 1.5.0

* Added `VideoEventType.videoSizeChanged` so `VideoPlayerValue.size` tracks the
  rendition being decoded instead of staying at whatever loaded first. On an
  adaptive stream this is what tells you an ABR or `setTrack` switch has taken
  effect, which previously had no signal on either platform.
* Android reports it from `Player.Listener.onVideoSizeChanged`, applying pixel
  aspect ratio and rotation so it matches the iOS value.
* iOS reports it from the existing `presentationSize` observer, which until now
  only reached `onReadyToPlay` and was discarded once initialised.
* Added `VideoPlayerValue.errorDetails`, carrying the Media3 `errorCode` and
  `errorCodeName` on Android, the NSError domain and code on iOS, and `httpStatus`
  on both when the failure came from a response code. Previously every failure
  arrived as one unstructured string, so an expired token and a dropped network
  were indistinguishable.
* Fixed a non `PlatformException` error being discarded by a `copyWith` whose
  result was never assigned.
* Added `VideoEventType.videoBitrateChanged` and `VideoPlayerValue.bitrate`, from
  the Media3 `onVideoInputFormatChanged` analytics callback on Android and the
  `indicatedBitrate` of the newest access log entry on iOS.
* Added `VideoEventType.playbackMetrics` and `VideoPlayerValue.metrics`, carrying
  dropped frames and a bandwidth estimate on both platforms, plus stall count and
  startup time on iOS. Figures the running platform cannot supply are null rather
  than zero.
* Added `VideoEventType.tracksChanged` and `VideoPlayerValue.track`, reporting the
  selected video track's id, dimensions, bitrate, frame rate and codec from the
  Media3 `onTracksChanged` callback. Android only: AVFoundation exposes no
  equivalent, so `videoSizeChanged` remains the cross platform signal.
* Playback now pauses when headphones are unplugged or a Bluetooth device goes
  out of range, rather than continuing out loud on the speaker. Android sets
  `setHandleAudioBecomingNoisy`, iOS observes route changes.
* iOS now observes audio session interruptions, so a call or alarm no longer
  leaves the player reporting itself as playing after the system silenced it.

## 1.4.1

* Added support for Built-in Kotlin on Android (AGP 9.0+) while maintaining full backward compatibility with Flutter 3.41.0+ and AGP < 9 (#128)
* Fixed iOS native player memory leak on dispose: unregister `dataSourceDict`, break FlutterEventChannel retain cycle, detach player layers, and clean up notification center (#129)
* Fixed iOS latent KVO crash on deallocation: weakly track `observedItem` to safely unregister observers, and ensure observers are removed before `currentItem` checks in `clear()` (#129)
* Preserved iOS background transition notification handler when playback ends or loops (#129)
* Upgraded Android Media3 dependencies to 1.11.0

## 1.4.0

* Inlined and modernized `visibility_detector` to remove the unmaintained external dependency and prevent Flutter/Dart version conflicts
* Fixed static analysis issue (`prefer_if_elements_to_conditional_expressions`) restoring full 160/160 pub points
* Optimized Android native dependencies by removing unused `media3-datasource-cronet`, `media3-session`, and obsolete artifacts
* Added Android R8 / Proguard consumer rules (`consumer-rules.pro`) for safe and effective release shrinking
* Fixed Android Activity memory leak on detachment (`onDetachedFromActivity`)
* Fixed potential event queue leak on player disposal in Android (`BetterPlayer.kt`)
* Hardened `BetterPlayerListVideoPlayer` against race conditions during fast list scrolling/disposal
* Optimized package archive size on pub.dev by excluding heavy example native runners and test media in `.pubignore`

## 1.3.5

* Fixed Android hardware decoder failure by adding software decoder fallback (thanks @ZhaosongRen)
* Fixed Android play/pause notification state not syncing from native player changes (thanks @mmeshrif)
* Fixed `NullPointerException` in `_BetterPlayerVideoFitWidgetState.dispose` and unassigned ClearKey `DrmSessionManager` on Android (thanks @vivek995378)
* Fixed Simplified Chinese translations (thanks @zs)

## 1.3.4

* Fixed iOS build error: duplicate `BetterPlayerPlugin` interface definition caused by CocoaPods exposing ObjC header alongside Swift-generated header; excluded `BetterPlayerPlugin.h/m` from podspec source files
* Fixed iOS Profile build configuration missing `Profile.xcconfig`, causing CocoaPods base config conflict
* Fixed Android example `build.gradle.kts` missing `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` plugin, causing unresolved `kotlin { compilerOptions }` block

## 1.3.3

* Fixed iOS podspec version mismatch (was stuck at `1.3.0`), now synced with `pubspec.yaml`
* Fixed initial track setup not awaiting `setTrack`, which could race with data source setup

## 1.3.2

* Fixed iOS HLS playback with `useCache: true` for modern fMP4/CMAF streams (`#EXT-X-MAP`, `.m4s`, external audio renditions) by playing HLS directly through `AVURLAsset` instead of the localhost reverse proxy
* Fixed iOS Swift compile errors: aligned `Cache` dependency to 6.x for both CocoaPods and SPM (Cache 7.x is not published on CocoaPods) and restored the `AVURLAssetHTTPHeaderFieldsKey` string literal
* Fixed player layout not refreshing after manual HLS/DASH quality track switch: `setTrack` now updates the reported video size and emits a `changedTrack` controller event
* Fixed duplicate `@interface BetterPlayerPlugin` definition in the iOS plugin header
* Hardened iOS HLS header conversion with typed `String`/`NSNumber` handling
* Removed unused `HLSCachingReverseProxyServer`, `GCDWebServer` and `PINCache` dependencies from the iOS podspec
* Optimized iOS BoxFit handling with scheduled application
* `CacheManager.setup()` is now a deprecated no-op on iOS (no HLS proxy setup needed)

## 1.3.1

* Updated iOS dependencies and cleaned up stale SPM `Package.resolved` pins
* Minor cleanup in `better_player_with_controls.dart`

## 1.3.0

* Added iOS Swift Package Manager (SPM) support
* Added `Package.swift` to support native SPM integration
* Migrated iOS plugin source files from `Classes/` to `better_player_plus/Sources/better_player_plus/` for SPM compatibility
* Cleaned up legacy CocoaPods integration from the iOS example project for smoother SPM-based builds

## 1.2.1
